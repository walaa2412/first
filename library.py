#Task - create a program for a Library, where Students can take out and return books. The library can lend, and update the collection (when a student returns books)
#Here we will be demonstrating abstraction and encapsulation (more on encaspulation later)
#=======For the Library Class, layers of abstraction ==> *display available books, *lend books, *add books
#=======For the Student Class, layers of abstraction: ==> *request a book* and *return a book*
#Note for abstraction: You are only dealing with the important and relevant details of a library...not the irrevelant details like no. of shelves, or the cobwebs on the cielings!
"""
Task: Based on the creation of this class implementation of a library management system, try and attempt the following:
>>Car rental system.
Your program should perform the following:
1. SUV, Sports and Hatchback are the type of cars that are available for rent
2. Cost per day: Hatchback - �10 Sedan - �100 SUV - �200
3. Prompt the customer for: Type of Car, and the no. of days he would like to borrow the car for.
4. Provide the fare details/output to the customer.
